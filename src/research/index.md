# Introduction

*What is the role of technology in regeneration?*

[Chora](https://chora.io/) is a research project exploring the role of technology in regeneration with a focus on the use of decentralized blockchain protocols for commons governance and regenerative economics.

<!-- ## Blockchain Protocols

Decentralized blockchain protocols are community governed networks.

"Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as blockchain have lately given new impetus to the emergence of a new generation of authentic “sharing economy,” protected from capture by thorough distribution of power over infrastructure, that spans not only digital but also physical production of common value."

## Commons Governance

- "The commons is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately."

- "Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism."

- "Commons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates."

## Regeneration

The best time to start regenerating our planet and rebuilding local and bioregional ecosystems and economies was yesterday.

We are facing global warming, climate change, mass extinction, and total planetary collapse, and unfortunately there are no easy solutions.

We now must out cooperate the competition, overcome our competitive impulses, and look for new ways to work together to solve the most pressing issues of our time.

New technologies will not save us alone. We have to change our culture, our habits, and how we think about the natural resources we share on this planet.

We have to change the incentives... this is why **carbon credits** have become so popular recently. The pressure is being placed on corporations and goverments to offset their carbon footprint.

We can realign the incentive structure with a carbon market, which is not a silver bullet but a step in the right direction. We can reimagine an economic system tied to natural resources.

How might DeFi lead climate finance? Climate finance is going to be a bigger industry than oil and gas. All of the public goods accounting works much bettter within a blockchain ecosytem. "I actually think that we're going to see this sort of dark horse use case of decentralized finance and infrastructure we are all building lead the way".
