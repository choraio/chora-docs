<!-- ## Regeneration

*What is the role of technology in regeneration?*

The best time to start regenerating our planet and rebuilding local, bioregional, and planetary ecosystems and economies was yesterday.

We are facing global warming, climate change, mass extinction, and total planetary collapse, and unfortunately there are no easy solutions.

We now must out cooperate the competition, overcome our competitive impulses, and look for new ways to work together to solve the most pressing issues of our time.

New technologies will not save us alone. We have to change our culture, our habits, and how we think about the natural resources we share on this planet.

We have to change the incentives... this is why **carbon credits** have become so popular recently. The pressure is being placed on corporations and goverments to offset their carbon footprint.

We can realign the incentive structure with a carbon market, which is not a silver bullet but a step in the right direction. We can reimagine an economic system tied to natural resources. -->

## Regen Network

Regen Network is focused on building ecosystem services and credits using an application specific blockchain. Regen Network's `regen-ledger` is built with Cosmos SDK and will be a Cosmos zone within the Cosmos ecosystem.

Regen Network will be launching their mainnet version of `regen-ledger` mid-April with the `ibc` module enabled, which means any other blockchain with the `ibc` module enabled will be able to communicate with Regen Network.

The `ibc` module is important to the use case of Regen Network because it enables the ability for other blockchains to integrate and purchase "eco credits" from `regen-ledger` *(note: the `ecocredit` module will not be enabled initially but enabled through an on-chain governance process)*.

The initial mainnet version of `regen-ledger` will allow for the exchange of the native `regen-ledger` token "REGEN", which is the token used in staking to secure the network, the token used to vote in on-chain governance processes, and the token used to pay fees for sending messages.

<!-- As a consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is much more energy efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW), but both still use energy and therefore accumulate a carbon footprint. Using `regen-ledger` with the `ibc` module will allow blockchains to offset their carbon footprint through the purchase of "eco credits" from Regen Network's `regen-ledger` using the `ecocredit` module.

The `ibc` module is what makes it possible for DeFi to lead climate finance. Climate finance is going to be a bigger industry than oil and gas. All of the public goods accounting works much bettter within a blockchain ecosytem. "I actually think that we're going to see this sort of dark horse use case of decentralized finance and infrastructure we are all building lead the way".

Regen Network's `ecodata` module allows for tracking data related to ecological claims both on and off-chain. -->
