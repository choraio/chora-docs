# Introduction

[Chora](https://chora.io/) is a research project exploring the role of technology in regeneration with a focus on the use of decentralized blockchain protocols for commons governance and regenerative economics.

<!-- ## Regeneration

The best time to start regenerating our planet and rebuilding local and bioregional ecosystems and economies was yesterday.

We are facing global warming, climate change, mass extinction, and total planetary collapse, and unfortunately there are no easy solutions.

We now must out cooperate the competition, overcome our competitive impulses, and look for new ways to work together to solve the most pressing issues of our time.

New technologies will not save us alone. We have to change our culture, our habits, and how we think about the natural resources we share on this planet.

We have to change the incentives... this is why **carbon credits** have become so popular recently. The pressure is being placed on corporations and goverments to offset their carbon footprint.

We can realign the incentive structure with a carbon market, which is not a silver bullet but a step in the right direction. We can reimagine an economic system tied to natural resources.

How might DeFi lead climate finance? Climate finance is going to be a bigger industry than oil and gas. All of the public goods accounting works much bettter within a blockchain ecosytem. "I actually think that we're going to see this sort of dark horse use case of decentralized finance and infrastructure we are all building lead the way". -->

## Green NFT

The current focus of the project is research and development for the [Green NFT Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/green-nft/onboard).

In response to concerns around the carbon footprint of minting and exchanging NFTs on the current Proof-of-Work version of Ethereum, conscientious artists and platforms are looking for ways to offset their carbon footprint or make use of infrastructure that is more energy efficient.

Within the Ethereum ecosystem, there are scaling solutions that will reduce the energy cost as well as plans to switch Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, which means partial solutions are already underway. Although significantly less energy will be consumed with such improvements, there will still always be an energy cost, which is where the purchasing of "eco credits" comes in.

## Regen Network

[Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) is a project focused on building ecosystem services and credits using an application specific blockchain. Regen Network's blockchain [`regen-ledger`](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger) is built with [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and will be a Cosmos zone within the Cosmos ecosystem.

Within the Cosmos ecosystem, blockchains are able to communicate with each other using a protocol known as "interblockchain communication protocol" or [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go), which is defined as a module within the Cosmos SDK. Regen Network will be launching their mainnet version of `regen-ledger` mid-April with the `ibc` module enabled, which means other blockchains with the `ibc` module enabled will be able to communicate with Regen Network to integrate and purchase "eco credits".

What about the purchase of "eco credits" from outside the Cosmos ecosystem?

## Gravity Bridge

[Gravity Bridge](https://github.com/cosmos/gravity-bridge) is a blockchain bridge between the Cosmos ecosystem and Ethereum that currently supports the transfer ERC20 assets originating on Ethereum to a Cosmos based blockchain and back to Ethereum. The ability to transfer the equivelant of an ERC20 asset originating on a Cosmos based blockchain to an ERC20 representation on Ethereum is currently in development.

## Chora Chain

In order to better understand communication between blockchains within the Cosmos ecosytem, we will be experimenting with our own application specific blockchain called `chora-chain`, which is also built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
